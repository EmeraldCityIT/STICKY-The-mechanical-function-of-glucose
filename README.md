# STICKY-The-mechanical-function-of-glucose
Glucose is used as a handling agent for zooids. Without glucose zooids are unable to transport molecules, proteins, dendrites, plant material (spices), etc. Without the ability to transport materials through the body, dendrites will shutdown and organs which depend on the ability to cling or filter a particular substance will shut down.
